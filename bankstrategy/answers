How would you implement this using inheritance?
By sub classing the Account class and by overriding methods in it. 

How many classes would be needed to provide for all the permutations?
One class each for a permutation.

What happens if another two variations of one of these rules are added later?
Either new logic is added to existing class (using conditional statements) 
or Two more classes are required, which overrides the methods to add this variation.

What happens if the bank manager wants to grant a special consideration to a customer, waiving fees for a month?
In case of inheritance, need to add (extend) some conditional logic to the method. 

Is there duplication of any algorithmic code in this approach?
Yes, for rules that are not changing in the class, the code will be redundant.
